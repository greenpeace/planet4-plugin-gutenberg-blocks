## Introduction

This WordPress plugin is an attempt to convert the old [shortcake shortcode blocks](https://github.com/greenpeace/planet4-plugin-blocks) to gutenberg blocks and implement new blocks in the future.

## Build Setup

Wordpress provides a single dependency for the whole build setup including:

* Babel: the transpiler for JSX & ES6 syntax to browser-compatible JS
* Webpack: the bundler for all the JS modules and dependency resolution

The default config expects a single entry point which produces a single output bundle and adds two directories to the root.

We use a customized config to have this:

```
react-blocks
  src                      - The JSX files
    blocks                   - Block definitions for the editor (title, icon)
    components               - Components used to render the blocks (reusable, shareable)
  build                    - The compiled output
  editorIndex.js          - The main JS for the editor
  frontendIndex.js        - The main JS for the frontend
```

### PHP Side

Everything is under `classes` folder, besided the plugin's entrypoint file (`planet4-gutenberg-blocks.php`)

```
classes
  blocks                   - Blocks classes
  controller               - Components used to render the blocks (reusable, shareable)
  class-loader.php         - Loader. Defines plugin's hooks/filters and blocks.
```


### Twig templates
Plugin depends on [timber-library](https://el.wordpress.org/plugins/timber-library/)  which is used for twig template engine. Twig templates are used to generate the blocks' output.

## How to develop a new block you ask?

1. Create a new class that extends `Base_Block` ( `P4GBKS\Blocks\Base_Block` ) inside directory _classes/blocks_. The class name should follow naming convention, for example **Blockname** and its file name should be class-**blockname**.php.

1. Implement its parent's class abstract method. In block's **constructor** you need to define the block's details (fields, schema) using `register_block_type` and in method **prepare_data()** you need to prepare the data which will be used for rendering.

1. Create the template file that will be used to render your block inside directory _templates/blocks_. If the name of the file is **blockname**.twig then
you need to set the BLOCK_NAME constant as **'blockname'** It also works with html templates. Just add 'php' as the 3rd argument of the block() method.

1. Add your new class name to the array inside Loader's ( `P4GBKS\Loader` ) constructor.

1. Create a new folder inside _react-blocks/src/blocks_ named after your block **Blockname** (first letter capital - rest lowercase). Create two new files inside that folder named **Blockname.js**  and **BlocknameBlock.js**.

	 **BlocknameBlock.js** should be a class that uses wordpress [registerBlockType](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/developers/block-api/block-registration/) to define the block's attributes, schema and `edit()` function.
 `edit()` function should return a react component that will be used for rendering the block in the editor.
`save()` function should return null as we use server side rendering currently.

	**Blockname.js** should be a class that defines a React component that implements `renderEdit()` and `renderView()`.
`renderEdit()` should be used to render the block in the editor, to define editor-specific things as sidebar options, in-place edit components, and so on. `renderView()` will be used both in the editor and in the frontend site to render the block's contents, as we are rendering blocks using React in the frontend too.

	To learn more details about the render logic, refer to the [blocks page in Planet4's Gitbook](https://app.gitbook.com/@greenpeace/s/planet4/tech/blocks/).

1. Create a new sccs file inside _react-blocks/src/blocks/styles_ named after your block **Blockname.scss** to use for block's frontend styling.

    Create a new file named **BlocknameEditor.scss** to use for block's editor styling if you need to style the block in the editor.

1. Finally, before committing do **npm run build** to build the plugin's assets and **vendor/bin/phpcs** to check for any php styling errors in your code.


## Assets build

You'll need NPM to install the dependencies, just run  `npm install`  to install them.

To develop:

-   run  `npm start`  to start a watcher on the  `react-blocks/src`  directory and rebuild everytime you make a change, output will be at  `react-blocks/build`.

-   run  `npm build`  to manually build the files.


## Composer
We use composer as dependency manager for the this plugin.
To install dependencies run

`$ composer install`

## Code standards
We follow the [WordPress Coding Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/php/)

We use a custom [php codesniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) ruleset which adds some rules over WordPress-Core, WordPress-Docs and WordPress-Extra rulesets.

[WordPress Coding Standards Rulesets](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress-Coding-Standards)

[WordPress Coding Standards Wiki](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress-Coding-Standards/wiki)

To run the [php codesniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer)

`$ vendor/bin/phpcs`
 or
`$ composer sniffs`

To run the [php code beautifier and fixer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer/wiki/Fixing-Errors-Automatically)

`$ vendor/bin/phpcbf`
 or
`$ composer fixes`
